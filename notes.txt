Parser notes

TODO
- FIRST() and empty
  - page 221
  - compute all FIRST sets at once?
  - "until no more terminals or <empty> can be added to any FIRST set"?

- begin thinking about efficiency concerns
  - closure is starting to get ugly
  - with the c2 grammar, gprof shows 67% in operator<(parser_item)
  - hash_map or unordered_map?  or just new data structure?
- write code to display specific shift/reduce issue
  - this will allow running without such extensive dumping
- convert production has into stack of productions
  - this is required for supporting scoped changes to the grammar
- write simple test for extending syntax on the fly
  - introduce custom code to trigger
- C API
  - struct tree_node, char * head, etc
- tokenizer
  - separate file (compile time is growing)
  - simple regex engine (should be easy compared to parser)
  - tokenizer spec built into grammar files
