Parser notes

TODO
- debug LR(1) support
  - very close
- begin thinking about efficiency concerns
  - closure is starting to get ugly
  - with the c2 grammar, gprof shows 67% in operator<(parser_item)
  - hash_map or unordered_map?  or just new data structure?
- write code to display specific shift/reduce issue
  - this will allow running without such extensive dumping
- convert production has into stack of productions
  - this is required for supporting scoped changes to the grammar
- write simple test for extending syntax on the fly
  - introduce custom code to trigger

- experiment with grammars for next generation language
  - typing like ML
